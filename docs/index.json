Projects allow you to share clusters with other users and make it easier to collaborate.\nStep 1 – Create a Project After you log in to Kubermatic, you will be greeted with the list of all projects you created or have been given access to. When first using Kubermatic, the list will be empty and you will need to create your first project.\nClick on the button above the table or the link below to table to create your first project. Give it a descriptive name and click \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo;.\nAfter a short moment, your project will be ready.\nStep 2 – Select Your Current Project To manage clusters, you need to select in which project you would like to work. This can be achieved by either clicking the project in the project list or by using the dropdown in the top-left corner (it is visible only when you are already in one of the projects).\nAfter selecting the current project, the menu items for managing clusters, members and service accounts become active.\nStep 3 – Create a Cluster Refer to the cluster documentation for more information on how to create and manage clusters.\nStep 4 – Manage Project Members After selecting a project like in step 2, click on \u0026ldquo;Members\u0026rdquo; in the menu on the left to see the list of active members. If you are the owner, you can add and remove members in your project. To add a member, just like adding a project or a cluster, use the button above the member list. Add the e-mail address of an existing user and define their role in the project.\n Editors have write access to your project and can manage clusters, nodes and SSH keys. Viewers have read-only access and can only view the existing resources.  You can change the role for a user or remove them altogether at any time.\nAfter adding a user to a project, the project will immediately show up in the user\u0026rsquo;s project list.\nStep 5 - Manage Project Service Accounts After selecting a project like in step 2, click on \u0026ldquo;Service Accounts\u0026rdquo; in the menu on the left to see the list of active service accounts. If you are the owner of the project, you can add and remove service accounts and manage tokens that belong to them as well. To add a service account, just like adding a project or a cluster, use the button above the service account list. Add the name and select the group to assign.\n Editors have write access to your project and can manage clusters, nodes and SSH keys. Viewers have read-only access and can only view the existing resources.  You can change the role for a service account or remove them altogether at any time.\n"

After choosing the project, the relevant menu items will become active.\nGo to clusters view by clicking on \u0026ldquo;Clusters\u0026rdquo; menu entry and then click on the \u0026ldquo;Add Cluster\u0026rdquo; button in the top right corner to go to the cluster wizard.\nStep 2 – Specify the Cluster Name and Kubernetes Version The cluster name is how you will identify your Kubernetes cluster instance. Choose a name that is easy for you to remember. You must also select your desired Kubernetes version.\nStep 3 – Choose a Cloud Provider for Your Kubernetes Nodes Choose a cloud provider for your Kubernetes nodes to be deployed by Kubermatic. Your nodes can be placed in any cloud you like.\nStep 4 – Select the Datacenter of Your Cloud Provider This is the datacenter of your cloud provider. Your worker nodes will get deployed there.\nStep 5 – Enter Your Provider Credentials and Configure Your Worker Nodes Enter your provider specific credentials so that Kubermatic can configure your worker machines and integrate them into your cluster.\nThis step varies depending on the selected provider! You will be asked for different provider credentials when choosing AWS or Google for example.\n Step 6 – Review Your Configuration Settings and Confirm Cluster Creation Check whether all your configuration settings are correct and create your cluster!\nPlease note that depending on the capacities in the seed cluster and the chosen cloud provider, cluster creation can take up to a few minutes until your nodes are ready.\n"
